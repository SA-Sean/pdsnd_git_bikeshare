## Data Required
Bikeshre data for three US cities is required for analysis. Namely: Chicago, New York City, Washington.
Data for each US city should be contained in its own, separate <code>csv</code> file.
Ensure the bikeshare data files are placed in the same folder as the Bikeshare python script. 

## Running Bikeshare
Using the termial application of your choice:
- <code>cd</code> into the folder where the bikeshare.py script is located
- enter the following command: 
```
    python bikeshare.py
```
- follow the interactive prompts in your terminal üòÉ
Note: inputs are case insensitive, however correct city spelling is important for the script to recognise the city for which bikeshare data you wish to view.
